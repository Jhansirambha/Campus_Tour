        <h2>BTech Fees Structure</h2>
        <p>B Tech course fees differ from one university to another and mostly depend on the type of engineering college. Before enrolling in any particular college, students should check the B.Tech admission process, BTech eligibility criteria and B Tech course fees. The average B Tech course fee ranges from Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 20 Lakhs.</p>
        <h2>Why Choose BTech Course?</h2>
        <p>There are multiple reasons to choose the Bachelor of Technology programme as the undergraduate degree programme. Individuals who have an interest in the invention of things or are filled with curiosity about how instruments, machines or software are developed, can opt for the BTech degree programme. Bachelor of Technology is designed to provide comprehensive knowledge of mathematics, engineering principles, computer applications, programming and electronics.

            Depending on their interest, students can opt for any specialisation such as B.Tech CSE, B.Tech textile engineering, B.Tech ME, B.Tech ECE and numerous other specialisations. A BTech degree provides ample job opportunities in the field of engineering and also equips students with practical knowledge and skills for life.</p>
           <h2>BTech Eligibility Criteria</h2>
           <p>For admissions into BTech programmes, the students will have to qualify for the 10+12th examination from the science stream from any board. If a student is interested or wants to get into a B.Tech programme, it is advised to study PCM (Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics) as the main subject, as individuals from this subject group are preferred for the programme. In this section, we have mentioned the eligibility for B.Tech after 12th.<br>

            <ul><li>Candidates should have scored at least 50 per cent marks in major subjects such as Maths, Physics, Computer Science, and Chemistry, in their class 10+2 from a recognised board.</li>
            <li>They need to qualify the entrance exam held by the colleges and universities you have applied for.</li>
            <li>After passing the entrance examinations, candidates need to appear for the counselling process.</li></ul></p> 
            <h2>BTech Course Duration</h2>
            <p>BTech course duration is four years, which is divided into eight semesters. BTech course covers the introductory subjects of engineering and technology and unlike other degrees, BTech has multiple specialisation. Although students can opt for an MTech degree programme to advance their career. The four-year B Tech course covers practical classes, dissertation, project work and theories.</p>
            <h2>Skill Required for B.Tech Degree</h2>
            <p>B.Tech degree students need to possess technical skills as well as social and emotional intelligence. Compassion, empathy, insights, knowledge, logic, and skill must all combine. B. Tech provides technical skills along with interpersonal skills. B Tech course develops a team spirit in students, helps them to be more accurate and precise, provides a platform to improve their communication skills, and teaches them resilience and self-discipline.
